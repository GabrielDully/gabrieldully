    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Computer Science student at IME-USP and a Software Engineer with a strong focus on back-end development, data science, artificial intelligence, and especially machine learning. I have practical experience in these areas, including research at the SÃ£o Paulo Court of Justice (TJSP), where I helped develop an AI system to classify first-instance legal sentences.

    <h2>Specialization Tracks at IME-USP</h2>
    <p>
      At IME-USP, Computer Science students can follow specialization tracks ("trilhas") that guide elective course choices and deepen knowledge in a specific area. These tracks help structure academic progression and may lead to official certification.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Software Systems:</strong> Focuses on building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems. Covers areas like software engineering, databases, distributed systems, and agile methodologies.</li>
      <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Prepares students to develop systems capable of cognitive tasks. Includes machine learning, robotics, knowledge-based systems, and AI theory.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Science:</strong> Emphasizes statistical analysis, machine learning, and large-scale data processing. Ideal for those who want to extract insights and build data-driven applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Theoretical Computer Science:</strong> Delves into algorithms, automata theory, optimization, and discrete mathematics. Suitable for students interested in computational theory and advanced problem solving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Chosen Track</h2>
    <p>
      Among the available specialization tracks at IME-USP, I chose to follow the <strong>Software Systems</strong> track. I believe that mastering the foundations of system design, distributed architectures, and agile development methodologies is essential to building impactful and reliable software in real-world environments. This track aligns strongly with my interests in back-end engineering, clean architecture, and the development of scalable systems.
